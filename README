PARKINGGO

PARKINGGO is an application designed to help drivers find an available parking spot in the 4 Towers Area of Madrid. 
By combining a Quicksort algorithm to sort parking spots by proximity and a Greedy Algorithm to find the best match based on user preferences,
the app provides an efficient and personalized parking solution.

FEATURES:

1. Sorts Spots by Proximity: The algorithm uses a Quicksort algorithm to rank parking spots based on 
   their distance from the user's current location.

2. Spot Selection: A Greedy Algorithm evaluates and selects the best parking spot considering:

                 - Parking duration availability
                 - Cost per minute
                 - User preferences for cost vs. distance priority

PREREQUISITES:

  - Python 3x
  - Required library: "pandas"

INSTALLATION:

  - Clone this repository:

        git clone https://github.com/cecirus/PARKINGGO.git

  - Install dependencies:

        pip install pandas

  - Add the parking dataset as a CSV file parking_spots.csv

USAGE:

1.  Run the Program: python parkinggo.py
2.  Enter your location coordinates (latitude and longitude) when asked by the program.
3.  Specify:
  - Desired parking duration
  - Importance of cost vs. distance.
4.  The app will output:
  - A sorted list of nearby parking spots.
  - The best parking spot based on your preferences.

#EXAMPLE OF INPUT

Enter your latitude: 40.4785073
Enter your longitude: -3.6919072
How long do you plan to park (in minutes)? 120
How important is cost? (Enter 1 for equal importance and 2 if it's a priority): 1
How important is distance? (Enter 1 for equal importance and 2 if it's a priority): 2

#EXAMPLE OF OUTPUT

The best parking spot for you is:
Name: Spot 35
Cost per minute: $0.01
Total cost for 120 minutes: $1.20
Available time: 240 minutes
Zone: Sanitary
